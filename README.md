# Neighbourhood map with Google Maps API

This project consumes a JSON API from Doors Open Toronto, a dataset of more than  130 architecturally, historically, culturally and socially significant buildings across the city. In combination with Google Maps, it plots these locations on an accessible map along with a searchable list of locations.

## Features

* Materialize CSS framework
* Google Maps API
* AJAX calls with jQuery
